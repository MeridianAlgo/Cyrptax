# GitHub Deployment Instructions

## Repository Setup

The project is now organized and ready for GitHub deployment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner

   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for open source)
   - **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### 2. Push to GitHub

Once the repository is created, run these commands:

```bash
# The repository is already initialized and committed locally
# Just need to push to the remote

# Add the remote (already done)
git remote add origin https://github.com/MeridianAlgo/Cryptax.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Configuration
